# Stock-Predictor-App

This is a simple stock market predictor application that uses a pre-trained Keras model to predict stock prices based on historical data. The application is built using Streamlit for the user interface and leverages the yfinance library to fetch historical stock data.

Installation
Before running the code, make sure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install them using the following:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas yfinance keras streamlit matplotlib numpy scikit-learn
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-market-predictor.git
cd stock-market-predictor
Run the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run stock_predictor_app.py
Open your web browser and navigate to the provided URL (usually http://localhost:8501).

Enter the stock symbol and click the "Predict" button to see the predicted vs. actual stock prices.

Code Explanation
The code consists of a Streamlit app with the following key components:

Model Loading:

Loads a pre-trained Keras model from the specified file (StockModel.h5).
Data Fetching:

Retrieves historical stock data using the yfinance library for the specified stock symbol and date range.
Data Visualization:

Displays the stock data using Streamlit, including the closing price and moving averages (MA50, MA100, MA200).
Model Prediction:

Uses the loaded Keras model to predict stock prices based on the testing data.
Results Visualization:

Plots the original and predicted stock prices for comparison.
Note
Make sure to replace the placeholder C:\StockPrice\StockModel.h5 with the actual path to your pre-trained model.

Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed before running the application.

This code assumes that you have a trained Keras model saved in the specified location.

Feel free to customize the code according to your needs and add additional features or improvements!
